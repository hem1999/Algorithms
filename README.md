Hello! Incase you are viewing my repo and didn't get what you are seeing this is for you to better understand what this is?

The primary objective of this repository is:
My college interviews are around and so I want to learn and implement as many algorithms as possible and making this repository to make 
my friends and co-learners use it incase they need

Incase you want to know what all I thought of doing there are two images that contains almost all the things that I want to do practice, implement and learn!


Incase you want to help me out in anything:
Please do go through every algorithm or implementation of data structure and try to do it in less time and I would be more than happy to learn from others. You can help me out implementing algorithms or suggestion
